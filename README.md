This is my first Arduino project, very simple :v
Install Arduino IDE first and check your port 
Before you run this code, you must connect with your Arduino (Hardware)
Here are the tools i used :
5 LED
1 Breadboard
6 Male-male cable
Arduino UNO
USB cable

I'm still learning, hope we can learning together :)
Happy learning!
